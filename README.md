## Project Structure

This repository contains the following key files:

*   `Final_Report.docx`: The final, professional report detailing the problem, evidence, and recommended solutions. 
*   `log_analyzer.py`: A Python script that parses the `sample-log.log` file and prints a summary of the top traffic sources to the console.
*   `sample-log.log`: The raw data file provided for the project.
*   `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to use it.
